# CORRECTED for Render's actual compute model: CPU + RAM only, no GPU
# (earlier -ngl/--flash-attn advice assumed a GPU instance that doesn't
# exist here - those flags are removed).
#
# The real problem with the original script: no --threads was set at
# all. llama.cpp's thread auto-detection frequently misreads cgroup CPU
# quotas inside containers and picks a number far below what's actually
# allocated - so despite paying for 8-12 CPUs, llama-server may have
# been generating on as few as 1-4 threads the whole time. A 1.5B Q4
# model on properly-used 8-12 CPU cores should produce a short JSON plan
# in low single-digit seconds, not 45-120s.
#
#   --threads N          Threads used for token generation. Set explicitly
#                         rather than trusting auto-detect. Using N-2
#                         leaves headroom for the Flask/Gunicorn process
#                         and OS scheduling running alongside it in the
#                         same container. Adjust the number below to
#                         whatever this specific service is actually
#                         provisioned with (8-12 cores per your answer -
#                         using 10 as a middle-ground default; push to 12
#                         if you confirm the full 12 is dedicated to this
#                         service, or down to 6-8 if the count is on the
#                         lower end of that range).
#
#   --threads-batch N     Threads used for prompt processing specifically
#                         (can differ from generation threads). Matching
#                         it to --threads is a reasonable default.
#
#   --ctx-size 4096       This task is short structured JSON output - 4096
#                         tokens is plenty and keeps prompt-processing
#                         cost bounded. Raise only if you hit truncation.
#
#   --parallel 1          The Electron client only ever has one goal in
#                         flight at a time (see runtime.cjs's
#                         currentGoalEntry gate), so a single processing
#                         slot is correct and avoids wasted memory on
#                         unused parallel slots.
#
#   --batch-size 512      Default is usually fine, but setting it
#                         explicitly avoids surprises across llama.cpp
#                         versions. Raise if prompt processing (not
#                         generation) turns out to be the slow part.
